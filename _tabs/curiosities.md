While my own page is under construction, I'll refer you to some other interesting pages and stimulating thoughts that I found on the web. Enjoy! 

## Other cool science
- Bert Hubert has an interesting blog article that [explains DNA in computer science terms](https://berthub.eu/amazing-dna/). He recently also wrote a very readable explanation of [how the BioNTech/Pfier covid-19 vaccine works](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/).

## Finding research articles
- [Semantic scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/): A great search engine for papers that allows you to customize your feed according to your interests. They recently introduced a handy TLDR-text summarization feature.
- Andrej Karpathy's [arxiv sanity preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/) for scanning arxiv for the the latest and interesting pre-prints, using simple NLP techniques. 

## Cool machine learning related sites
- [Srinivasnan Keshav's advice](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Advice) contains lots of gems. I denfinitely recommend checking it out.
- [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/) contains a great guide for current PhD students as well as excellent explanations of reinforcement learning and recurrent neural nets.
- [Chris Olah's blog](https://colah.github.io/) has great explanations of various topics in deep learning. His treatment of LSTMs and attention is particularly good!
- [Distill](https://distill.pub/) is a cool, interactive journal that aims at communicating science interactively through papers as webblogs. Definitely worth checking out.


## Fun
- The classic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comics. I particularly enjoyend this recent one on [covid-19](https://xkcd.com/2287/).
- Lovely images of animals posing in the wild at [comedy wildlife photrography](https://www.comedywildlifephoto.com/gallery/finalists/2020_finalists.php).
