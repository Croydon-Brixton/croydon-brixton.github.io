## Research interests
I am interested in mitigating climate change and its effects, as well as biodiversity loss with the help of data science. As I am still fairly new to the environmental sciences side of things, I am currently exploring different opportunities.  

Among my research interests so far are:
- Deep Learning (in particular for the emulation of physical systems and in vision for remote sensing)
- remote-sensing (particularly from space)
- carbon sequestration
- biodiversity protection

An interesting fact that I recently learned is that while forests sequester a massive amout of carbon, forest fires anually emit around [8 billion tons of CO2 per year](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/9/697/2017/). This compares to about 36 billion tons of CO2 emitted annually from fossil fuels [by humans](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region?time=earliest..latest). In other words, if forest fires were a country, they'd be the second largest emitter (after China). This made me wonder about the potential to save gigatonnes of carbon emissions per year by improving forest fire mitigation.

Other research that interests me, but that I am not currently persuing is related to [quantum computing](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.094501), [quantum foundations](https://github.com/Croydon-Brixton/qthought) and the mathematical formalisation of [causality](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf).

## Past research projects
- __Master thesis__: Resource estimates for simulating U(1) lattice gauge theories on quantum computers at ETH Zurich and IBM Research Zurich. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10271).
- __Side project__: Simulating quantum thought experiments on a computer.  
 The project is geared in particular towards simulating the Frauchiger-Renner paradox and formalizing interpretations of quantum mechanics in mathematical language. Unfortunately I haven't yet found the time to fully finish this project. [Project Code](https://github.com/Croydon-Brixton/qthought).
- __Bachelor thesis__: I created meta materials for producing slow light in the microwave domain at ETH's [qudev lab](https://qudev.phys.ethz.ch/). By engineering the photonic band gap using different inductances and capacitances, we managed to delay the light by two orders of magnitude compared to a transmission line of the same length. Our technique can for instance be used to create on chip delay lines for qubit-qubit communication or to engineer a photonic bandgap.
