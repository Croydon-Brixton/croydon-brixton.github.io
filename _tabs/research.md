## Research interests
I am interested in mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss with the help of data science. As I am still fairly new to the environmental sciences, I am currently exploring different opportunities.  

Recently, I've become particularly interested in remote sensing, forests and forest fires. Forests sequester a massive amout of carbon and forest fires anually emit around 8 billion tons of CO2 per year. This compares to about 36 billion tons of CO2 emitted annually from fossil fuels by humans. In other words, if forest fires were a country, they'd be the second largest emitter (after China).

## Past research projects
- __Master thesis__: Resource estimates for simulating U(1) lattice gauge theories on quantum computers at ETH Zurich and IBM Research Zurich. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10271).
- __Side project__: Simulating quantum thought experiments on a computer.  
 The project is geared in particular towards simulating the Frauchiger-Renner paradox and formalizing interpretations of quantum mechanics in mathematical language. Unfortunately I haven't yet found the time to fully finish this project. [Project Code](https://github.com/Croydon-Brixton/qthought).
- __Bachelor thesis__: I created meta materials for producing slow light in the microwave domain at ETH's [qudev lab](https://qudev.phys.ethz.ch/). By engineering the photonic band gap using different inductances and capacitances, we managed to delay the light by two orders of magnitude compared to a transmission line of the same length. Our technique can for instance be used to create on chip delay lines for qubit-qubit communication or to engineer a photonic bandgap.
